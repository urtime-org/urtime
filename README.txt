# 🕒 UrTime – Time to Focus!

UrTime is a fun and interactive **Pomodoro productivity web app** designed to help users stay focused while working or studying. Built with care and creativity by me (**Harshini**) and my team mate (**Varun**) as part of our **Web Development Domain Internship at VaultofCodes**, this app blends functionality with a touch of charm ✨.
